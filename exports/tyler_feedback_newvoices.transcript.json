  "transcript": "Alright, so tell me what's going on with Tyler. Okay. Tyler's largely, I think an interaction concern with people. That's what it gets down to. I'm going to give a few different examples. So, I'll use pass down as one place that Tyler has struggled in the past where he will typically be when we go through repeat fails, for example, he doesn't really seem to believe in the repeat fails thing. Okay. So, he's not really typically aware of his tools. He can provide one- word answers or just I sent an email, what do you want from me. So, again, kind of and I've coached him on what really should be happening here is when mid current comes up, this is your workstation. Just take ownership of it. Talk about your top fails and what you need to do or go after there. Rather, it feels like we have to extract the information out of Tyler. In some cases, he has it. Other cases, not so much. He does not like to be challenged technically. Okay. If he does something where it's maybe a little bit, you know, there could be other details provided. Again, this is kind of that challenge with having to extract information from him, and all this feels like that, yeah, he doesn't like that. He just thinks that that's unreasonable. Why should I know that? Or I'm looking into it. That's fine. Okay. An analysis gap that I have communicated to him, I think that and this is where I think he breaks down a little bit in his data analysis and methodology when he's communicating with folks, that he does a pretty good job getting a problem statement together and getting some of the initial data that supports that to say there is a problem. But then he jumps immediately to probable causes for it and just says, here's the things. It might be a dose controller or a profiler or a source, go look at that. Okay. Rather than, again, doing an analysis that supports what one of those it may really be, rather than just kind of cherry picking what you think a solution might look like. In some recent meetings here, Tyler's been really rather aggressive with folks. So we were having our Amit and EE and subs discussion about how to set priorities and things in the morning and you know, he brings up some valid concerns. I think it's some interesting points that could be done, but he got particularly impassioned about it. It was kind of a, you know, cutting off people who were trying to respond and answer, in some cases making accusations of what the shift does or doesn't do. I think without really having a true understanding of what's going on there. And so when like for example, our supervisor was trying to articulate responses to some of these things and say, here's what my perspective is on that. No, no, no, that's not how it works and just like cut her off and started stomping over her with this happens more often than not and all these other things, you know? And so he doesn't really like, he doesn't do real well in trying to have a productive discussion about some of these things. So he's not really open to opposing opinions to kind of what he thinks the direction is, or he struggles at least to kind of have a back and forth constructive conversation about what could the answer possibly be. He kind of wants it to be his answer is the correct way. Yeah, yeah. And it's and I think what he's looking at is he's evaluating how, you know, this has happened at other companies, but is not really looking at, well, how is it happening here? And what do we need to have happen under these circumstances, this situation. So again, I think he's really having a challenge kind of meeting the team on that front. Okay. In general, another thing that's happened quite a bit is he's he won't set up meetings with folks to try to get things done. So this could be Amit or other groups, and it's taken me or or somebody else to push to get that actually set up to make that venue. Even though it's been like, have you set up a meeting to have that discussion? Have you tried to go in to talk to that technician about the direction of this tool or whatever, but he's not taking those steps. He sees it as other people's responsibility to get folks to listen to him. Okay. So he's had the feedback that that's not how it should work and they should be able to go out here and build these relationships, figure out how to get these things done and coordinate these actions as the mid current owner. Right. He kind of wants he's struggling to kind of get the influence through building relationships versus somebody just going and telling them like, hey, you should listen to Tyler. Yeah. Leadership and influence was actually a big piece of his mid-year that I gave him where, you know, cuz I think what he really struggles to engage with multiple people. He can have moments where he does this very well. It just doesn't seem to stick around for terribly long. The vendors and the shift team have been the groups where I think I perceive the most significant struggle for him. You know, we talked about the reluctance to schedule meetings already. And when he has to say the long downs or the repeat fails thing, he relies entirely on email. So he puts together some analysis and information on it and then fires off the email and I've done my job and I'm kind of hands off. That's what he thinks or how he behaves rather, rather than also saying like, who do I work with to get that or can I have a technical discussion? Because these are complex matters. I think many cases they really do require some one-on-one or in-face team discussion so that people can make sense of it and move the plans. So, he's not really getting great results from doing those things though. I would say what is good about it is that you can see the analysis that he's putting together. I can see where he's trying to to follow a pretty good structure. But again, you know, it's it's not incredibly helpful for team and there is still some of the cherry picked stuff coming out of that. Um, so this is where I, you know, I would link the methodology struggles back to this lack of influence that he has where he's not able to get people to work with things because he's just not or his plans because he's not engaging with them at all. Okay. Um or engaging with them, I should say, as well as he could or should. He actually thinks that he has amazing influence skills but struggles to gain influence with too many people. That's what I see. Okay. Um I've recommended a lot of strategies for him on this front to things that he could try to do, like um one-on-one discussions and even going in the fab and trying to find from folks like maybe learn some of the points of pain that it's around your workstation and try to come back with a solution to help people out, right? Like and learn to gain some of that influence by hearing problems and resolving them as a is a really good example. Um and I'd like to see that happen with Tyler for sure. Um yeah, meetings can go pretty crazy with them. I mean, it can be it can be one word no answer sorts of things to kind of hot, dominant and not engaging in the discussion, real productive, kind of defensive and that type of thing or um I would say defensive, but also I mean he's he's far like he's got beliefs and ideas that he wants to put out there, but they're just not usually approached real constructively. Okay. You know, and then when you see people have a lack of willingness to work with him, uh that also is very difficult when you see him not being willing to set up a meeting to work with people on things. I mean, that's been a challenge. So, this has been really kind of the crux of that conversation with Kyler. Um, you know, last week after the uh the meltdown during the the priority meeting was when I had my talk with him afterwards and let him know that it was like it felt irresponsible at this point to not move forward with performance management because, you know, if this is just going to continue to be what it is, it's just a lingering problem and you're not finding a way to engage with the group. Right. Um you know, he feels like you should just move on to a different module. And I was like, you can't just leave. Like this is a problem that needs to be addressed and fixed before anybody would feel good with making that move for him. Um he actually said that he was doing it again to me, something about that, you know, he's been previously ostracized for his ideas and he can't gain influence and do these things for people. And I think again, where I keep going back with that is you've got to have a good discussion with people. I watch folks in our group make and drive change all the time, but you're not bringing things in a way that's constructive or data driven and supported. They may be interesting ideas, but in many cases they're philosophical, not also technically driven and saying like, here's how I'm going to fix mid current. Here's what we could do about that. This is how I can contribute and what the benefits of those will be. So, it's very challenging that way. Mhm. Uh, yeah. okay. Um, is that kind of everything that you've seen observation- wise? I was going to shift us into kind of what you want to see from him if that's Yeah, I think that would be yeah, that'd be okay. Okay, yeah. Well, what would ideal state be? If he reacted to the feedback, what are you wanting to see from him? I think what this would turn into is when he goes into, well and we'll use passton as an example to begin, is you want to own his workstation and clearly communicate these things. So he would say, here's the issues, these are the things we're following up and looking into and he would be trying to find partnerships during the day, whether that's with Amit or the shift teams that he can go and get some of this work done. Um I'd like to hear some positive conversation and dialogue coming out of them on a consistent basis, right? And he has to listen to other folks too, rather than just I think roll over them on here's all the things. This is what you should do. I'm the equipment owner and I told you. So, um I think he would understand that it's okay for him to go in and to find and make those connections to the people on the floor and balance that with the need for him to say, this is how I'm working to address the daily fires and make sure people are resourcing and have good direction and then also stepping out so that he can build a a strategic direction that's informed by those kind of tactical concerns, those things that are taking away his time on a day-to-day basis potentially. Um right now, I would say that that is kind of a weakness, like the projects that he has together for supporting and driving the workstation aren't terribly strong right now. Um he is wrapping up a pretty good one for recipe pressure errors, but now we need to continue to move forward and find new things. Um I would say that he would understand and be able to communicate what he has going on when he comes into his one-on-one. So productively saying here's my priorities. This is what I'm working on and potentially where he could use some help on them. But um again, trying to get some of that clear has been very difficult with him. Okay, okay, great. Anything else you think that kind of summarizes everything? Yeah, probably. Okay, great.",
